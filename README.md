# CODSOFT

# Code Description

## Setup

This code is designed to run on Google Colab and is responsible for setting up the required environment and dependencies. It performs the following tasks:

- Installs the `libcudnn8` package with a specific version to ensure compatibility with CUDA 11.8.
- Uninstalls the `tensorflow`, `estimator`, and `keras` packages.
- Installs or updates the following Python packages:
  - `tensorflow_text`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `tensorflow_datasets`
  - `einops`

## Data Handling (Optional)

This section handles dataset management and retrieval. It provides two dataset options: `Flickr8k` and `Conceptual Captions`. The code checks whether the required data files exist and, if not, downloads and extracts them. The available dataset options are as follows:

- **Flickr8k**: Downloads the Flickr8k dataset, including images and corresponding captions, and prepares the data for training.
- **Conceptual Captions**: Downloads the Conceptual Captions dataset, which includes images and captions, and also prepares the data for training.

## Image Feature Extractor

This part of the code initializes an image model (`MobileNetV3Small`) pre-trained on ImageNet for extracting features from images. The model is configured to exclude the final classification layer.

## Text Tokenization

In this section, input text data is tokenized using the TextVectorization layer from TensorFlow. The text is standardized by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and adding `[START]` and `[END]` tokens.

## Prepare the Datasets

The `train_raw` and `test_raw` datasets contain 1:many `(image, captions)` pairs. The code replicates the image so that there are 1:1 images to captions. It also prepares the datasets for compatibility with Keras training by creating `(inputs, labels)` pairs.

## Model Definition

The model used for caption generation is a custom `Captioner` model. It combines image and text inputs and consists of multiple `DecoderLayers`. The model can generate captions for images with different temperatures, allowing for varying degrees of randomness in caption generation.

## Training

The model is compiled for training with the following configurations:

- Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of `1e-4`
- Loss function: Sparse softmax cross-entropy
- Metrics: Masked accuracy

The training process is performed with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Callbacks

A custom callback, `GenerateText`, is implemented to generate captions for a test image at the end of each training epoch. This callback provides feedback on caption generation during training.

## Attention Plots

The code allows for generating attention plots to visualize the model's focus when generating captions. Attention maps are computed and overlaid on the input image to highlight areas of interest.

## Usage (Optional)

If you have a picture link from the internet, you can provide the image URL, and the model will generate captions for it.

## Google Drive Integration

The code also includes integration with Google Drive for saving and loading datasets and model checkpoints.
